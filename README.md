Why it matters: Tech experts might appreciate precision and technical depth, while regular users need clarity and simplicity.

Impact: It shapes the tone, complexity, and examples you use. For experts, you can use specific terms and deeper technical explanations. For non-experts, focus on what the tech does, not how.

🎯 Strategies to Tailor Content for Different Audiences
Create different versions (beginner vs. advanced guides).

Use progressive disclosure: start simple, add complexity gradually.

Offer tooltips or glossaries for jargon or technical terms.

Include use-case based examples relevant to each group.

🔍 Gauging Existing Knowledge
Use pre-surveys, polls, or user feedback.

Observe user questions on forums, support tickets, or GitHub Issues.

Test content with a small sample audience before publishing widely.

🌐 Making Content Accessible
Use plain language (e.g., "click" instead of "execute").

Break content into chunks with bullet points and white space.

Include step-by-step instructions.

Provide helpful examples, tooltips, and diagrams.

💬 Plain Language Over Jargon
Jargon excludes or confuses. Plain language is inclusive and clear.

Example:

❌ “Authenticate using the OAuth2 protocol”

✅ “Log in using your email or Google account”

✏️ Simplifying Terms Improves Comprehension
“Start” instead of “initiate”

“Fix” instead of “resolve an error”

“Open the file” vs. “Execute the file with administrative privileges”

🖼️ How Examples & Visuals Help
Examples make abstract concepts relatable.

Visuals clarify workflows, data flows, or hierarchies.

Especially effective when explaining processes, architecture, or user interfaces.

🧭 Effective Visuals
Flowcharts: show processes or workflows.

Diagrams: explain architecture or component relationships.

Screenshots: great for UIs or setup guides.

Tables: ideal for comparing options or configurations.

📚 Headings and Subheadings
They guide the reader, improve skimming, and structure the document.

Help readers locate specific sections easily.

✍️ Best Practices for Headings
Keep them descriptive and consistent.

Use hierarchical formatting (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.).

Use active voice (e.g., “Install the App” instead of “App Installation”).

🏁 What to Include in a README Introduction
A brief description of what the product does.

The problem it solves or the use case.

A one-liner summary for quick understanding.

📌 Conveying Purpose & Features Succinctly
Use a value proposition statement:
“This tool lets users convert CSV files to JSON instantly, saving hours of manual work.”

Follow with a bulleted list of key features:
